1. We need to run postgres container and expose it to Port : 5432 .
2. We need to run redis container and expose it to Port : 6372 .
3. We need to run mailhog container and expose it to Port : 1234 .

Docker Compose allows us to run multiple Containers.

1. Create a docker-compose.yml file.

2. Run this command `docker compose up -d` .  //-d it will run this without attaching the CLI of the containers. 
3. This will run two containers at a time.

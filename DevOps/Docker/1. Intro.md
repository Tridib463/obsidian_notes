Docker is a containerization platform that allows developers to package their applications into CONTAINERS that can run on any operating system. It provides a number of advantages over traditional virtualization methods, including:

- Portability:
    
    Docker containers are portable and can run on any operating system that has the Docker engine installed. This makes it easy to deploy applications to different environments, such as development, testing, and production.
    
- Efficiency:
    
    Docker containers are more efficient than virtual machines because they share the host operating system's kernel. This means that they use less memory and CPU resources.

## VMs vs Docker

An OS has two layers ->
1. OS Applications Layer
2. OS Kernel (This part communicates with the Hardware System and the Software System)

### Docker ->

Docker Virtualizes the Applications Layer and Uses the Kernel of the HOST Operating System.

### VM ->

VM Virtualizes the entire Operating System.

Does not use HOST OS. It Boots up its own OS.

### Docker Desktop ->
1. Docker Engine - A Server with a long running daemon process called 'dockerd'.
2. Docker CLI (Client)  - To interact with the Docker Server.
3. GUI Client - To manage images and containers with Graphical User Interface.

## Images and Containers

Q. What is my laptop or machine ?
- HP
Q. What OS is running on it ?
- Windows 11

Images are Like OS. Containers are like laptops and machines.
You need Containers to run Images.
We can run a single Image on multiple Containers each of those containers will be Isolated.

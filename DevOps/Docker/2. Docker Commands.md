```docker pull {image_name}```
- Automatically pulls the latest version of the Image locally on our computer.

```docker run -it {image_name}```
- Starts a New Container and runs the latest version of the Image locally on our computer.
- If docker is unable to find the image on our local machine, it automatically downloads the Image and then starts the Container.
- ' -it ' is optional. Means it directly links us directly to the Command Line of the Container. Ctrl+D to exit.

```docker images```
- TO show the list of images.

```docker container ls```
- To show the list of Running Containers.

```docker container ls -a```
- To show the list of all Containers.

```docker start -i {container name}```
- To start an Old Container.

```docker stop {container name}```
- TO stop a Running Container.

## During Production

1. We make a Custom Image and we can name them anything. (WE MAKE CONTAINER FROM IMAGES)
![[Pasted image 20240701161237.png|300]]

2. Now we will tell the developers , that we have to run this Image on a Container and work on that Container. 
3. Similarly,  we can deploy this Image using Containers on any Cloud Provider.
4. We can start an 'Ubuntu' container and install NodeJS, MongoDB on them or We can directly install 'NodeJS' container from Docker Hub.

## Port Mapping

- Suppose we are running a NodeJS Server in a container and it is running on Port- 8000.
- But that port is isolated from the outside environment. If we do localhost:8000, it won't display anything. We have to expose that port to the outside world.

```
docker run -p -it 8080:80 nginx
```

This maps port 80 in the container to port 8080 on the host. You can access the nginx server by going to `http://localhost:8080` on your host machine.

### Running multiple ports

```
docker run -p 8080:80 -p 443:443 my-web-app
```

This maps both HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) ports from the container to the same ports on the host.

## Environment Variables

```
docker run -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD = my-secret-pw mysql
```

### Multiple environment variables

```
docker run -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD = rootpass -e MYSQL_DATABASE = myapp mysql
```

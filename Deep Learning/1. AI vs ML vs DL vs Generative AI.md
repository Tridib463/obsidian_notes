## AI ->
Build application that can perform its own task without human intervention.
- Netflix = Recommendation System
- Self-driving Car
At the end of the day we are Building some AI Products.

## ML ->
It focuses on developing ALGORITHMS and Statistical Models that enable computers to perform tasks without explicit programming instructions. 
Instead learn patterns and relationships from DATA, allowing them to make predictions based on the new input.
It is a subset of AI.
We perform these operations on Data so that we understand about the data and gain insights on it.

## DL ->
It was build to mimic HUMAN BRAIN through Multiple Neural Networks.

### The three important things we learn in DL are -->
1. ANN we can use this to train ML problem statements also
2. CNN and Object Detection FOR COMPUTER VISION
3. RNN and its variants for TEXT RELATED USE-CASES or TIME

### Deep- Learning models are basically of Two types -
1. Discriminative
     Classification, Regression, predictions ,etc
     Models are trained on Labeled Dataset

2. Generative AI
	  Generates new Data previously trained on Huge Dataset
	  - Large Language Models and
	  - Large Image Models

In Generative AI , we have models that have already been Trained on Huge Amounts of Data and based on any input it will generate a NEW ORIGINAL DATA.
Traditional Ml model classifies and finds existing content.

## LLM Models
![[Pasted image 20240412203525.png|600]]
LLama2 and Gemma are Open Source LLMs.

Foundation Model is the Base Model
NOW, we can use these Foundation Models for domain specific use cases also. That is where FINE-TUNING comes.
We can Fine-Tune with some Custom Datasets.

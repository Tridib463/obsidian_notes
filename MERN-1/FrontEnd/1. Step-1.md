This setup is common when you want to render a single root component (in this case, `<App/>`) for any URL that doesn't match any other specific routes.


## Routing in short ->

App.js

Layout.js
![[Pasted image 20240331181436.png|500]]

- `import { Outlet } from 'react-router-dom';`: This imports the `Outlet` component from `react-router-dom`. The `Outlet` is a placeholder where child routes will be rendered.
- `const Layout = () => { ... }`: This is a functional component named `Layout`.
- `<Outlet />`: This is where child routes will be rendered. In this case, it's a placeholder for the nested routes defined in the `App.js` file.

So, in summary, when the application starts, the `App.js` file sets up the routing configuration. When the URL matches the root path `/`, it renders the `Layout` component. The `Layout` component then renders its child routes based on the URL, either rendering the `Public` component for the root path or the `Login` component for the `/login` path.

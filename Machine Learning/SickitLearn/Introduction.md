## Part - 1
Intro of Scikit-learn pipeline.

## Part - 2 (Data Preprocessing)
The performance of the model really depends on how the data is pre-processed.

## Part - 3 (Judging a Model)
We will use built-in metrics that sickit-learn provides and also build custom metrics to Judge Our ML Model.

## Part - 4 (Meta Estimators) Or Post-processing
We may sometimes also need to apply data post-processing to the ML Pipleline.
